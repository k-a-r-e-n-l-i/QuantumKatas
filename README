DEUTSCH-JOSZA:
To test a new functions, an oracle must be defined in Q#. The function can then be tested by passing in the oracle to the AssertDJAlgorithmWorks function, along with the number of qubits N, and if the function is constant (true) or not (false).

SIMON:
The code tests all the functions defined in instances.json. To add a new function, the user must define a transformation matrix, which is a n-1 x n matrix containing n-1 linearly independent rows such that s*r % 2 = 0 for each row. Finally, s/kernel is defined to verify the result.
